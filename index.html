  <p id="description">
      Every artist dreads the feeling of his passion being a source of stress rather than a source of joy. It is near impossible to make art without compromise of some degree. I will always have the utmost respect for artists of any kind. They are some of the bravest souls alive.
      The following is a collection of images depicting what paradise looks like to me. It's all around, and it pains me to see it overlooked and undervalued.
